# CI/CD Implementation Guide

## Overview
Automated testing and deployment pipeline for SiZu Pay Platform using GitHub Actions with comprehensive smoke testing validation.

## Test Suites

### Quick API Smoke Tests
- **Script**: `scripts/quickSmokeTest.js`
- **Execution Time**: <1 second
- **Coverage**: 18 critical endpoints
- **Purpose**: Fast validation for PR checks

### Full Playwright Suite
- **Script**: `scripts/autoSmokeTest.js`
- **Execution Time**: 30-60 seconds
- **Coverage**: Complete browser-based testing
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive validation

## Workflow Configuration

### Triggers
- **Push to main branch**: Full test suite execution
- **Pull requests**: Validation before merge
- **Scheduled runs**: Nightly at 02:00 UTC

### Test Execution Flow
1. Environment setup (Node.js 18.x)
2. Dependency installation
3. Quick API smoke tests (exit on failure)
4. Full Playwright suite (if quick tests pass)
5. Report generation and artifact upload

### Artifacts
- `reports/quick-smoke-report.json`: API test results
- `reports/quick-smoke-report.txt`: Human-readable summary
- `reports/smoke-test-results.json`: Full test results

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
- GitHub Actions workflow configuration

- Deployment automation on success

## Usage

### Manual Execution
```bash
# Quick API tests
node scripts/quickSmokeTest.js

# Full test suite
node scripts/autoSmokeTest.js
```

### CI Integration
Tests run automatically on:
- Every push to main
- Every pull request
- Nightly schedule (2 AM UTC)
