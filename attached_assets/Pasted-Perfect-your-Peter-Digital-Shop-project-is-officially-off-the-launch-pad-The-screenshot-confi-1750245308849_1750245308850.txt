Perfect — your **Peter Digital Shop** project is officially off the launch pad. The screenshot confirms the Replit AI Agent has acknowledged your brand and tech stack, and locked in the correct initial scope. Let’s lock in the first set of code **you need to manually feed** to Replit to ensure:

* No duplicates
* No broken routing
* No half-baked scaffolding

📦 Libraries to install:
- client: `tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer framer-motion lucide-react react-router-dom`
- server: `express dotenv @square/square uuid cors`

⚙️ Also set up:
- Tailwind dark mode + base styling in `client/src/styles/`
- Basic home page: black glass background, large neon animated title "🎁 Peter Digital Shop"
- Express server `/api/gift-cards/issue` route that returns `{ success: true }` to test

✅ DO NOT add mock UI junk or placeholder projects.
✅ DO NOT generate multiple conflicting files.
✅ Name everything exactly as defined.
✅ Confirm Tailwind and Framer Motion are working on the home page with a neon animated logo.

Build this cleanly and stop. I will paste the next feature prompt afterward.
