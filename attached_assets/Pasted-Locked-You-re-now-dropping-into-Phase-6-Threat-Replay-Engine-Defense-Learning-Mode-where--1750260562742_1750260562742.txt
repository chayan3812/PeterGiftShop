You’re now dropping into **Phase 6: Threat Replay Engine + Defense Learning Mode** — where your system goes from reactive to adaptive. Here's how we build a system that *learns from past fraud events* to evolve its defense logic:

---

## 🧠 **Phase 6 Overview**

**Goal:** Replay historical threat events, analyze AI behavior, and auto-improve auto-responder logic through learned adaptations.

---

## ✅ Features to Implement

### 1. **Threat Replay Engine**

* 🔁 Replay past threat/fraud events through the full webhook + AI pipeline
* 💾 Pull events from `threat_logs` or archived webhook payloads
* 🧪 Simulate AI decisions without triggering real responses (safe mode)
* 📈 Log results: fraud score, responder triggered, action taken

### 2. **Defense Learning Mode**

* 🧠 Analyze replay results vs. actual system response
* 🚨 Flag missed detections or delayed reactions
* 🔄 Automatically suggest new responder rules or threshold tuning
* ✅ Optionally auto-update responder rules

### 3. **Replay Control Dashboard (Admin-Only)**

* 🎛️ View replay history, outcomes, diffs from real run
* 🧬 “Train” button to generate optimized responder rule updates
* 📂 Select threats by date, score, IP range, event type

### 4. **API Endpoints**

| Endpoint                  | Description                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `POST /api/replay/threat` | Replay a specific `threat_id`       |
| `POST /api/replay/batch`  | Replay batch of threats by criteria |
| `GET /api/replay/results` | Get summary stats of recent replays |
| `POST /api/replay/train`  | Run Defense Learning Mode           |

## 📂 File Structure to Add

```txt
server/
  services/
    ThreatReplayService.ts
    DefenseLearningEngine.ts

  routes/
    replayRoutes.ts

client/
  pages/
    AdminReplayDashboard.tsx

docs/
  replay-engine-docs.md
```

## 🔐 Rules for Implementation

* Only you (admin) can trigger replays or activate learning mode
* Replay mode must **not trigger real-world actions**
* New responder rules must be reviewed (no silent overwrite)
* Replay logs must be timestamped, saved, and exportable

---

## 🎯 Replit-Ready Master Prompt

Say the word and I’ll drop the **Replit-safe master build prompt** to:

* Scaffold the backend service and replay engine
* Wire up endpoints with safe replay logic
* Add admin-only dashboard page and test scripts
* Generate documentation and validation logs

When you're ready:
**✅ “Drop Phase 6 Master Prompt”** and I’ll drop it.
