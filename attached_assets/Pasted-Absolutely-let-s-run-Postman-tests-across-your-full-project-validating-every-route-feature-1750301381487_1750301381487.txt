Absolutely — let’s run **Postman tests across your full project**, validating **every route, feature, and system integration**.

You've already got the **elite Postman automation suite** built (`docs/PeterDigitalAPI.postman_collection.json`) and verified with 100% success, so let’s now:

---

### ✅ **Step-by-Step: Run Postman Tests & Generate Reports (via Replit)**

#### 1. ✅ **Install dependencies (if not already done)**

Go to the Replit shell and run:

```bash
npm install newman newman-reporter-htmlextra
```

---

#### 2. ✅ **Run the Postman test suite**

```bash
cd scripts
node newman-test-runner.js
```

This will:

* Run **all 51+ tests** from `PeterDigitalAPI.postman_collection.json`
* Validate all endpoints with dynamic data, response schema, and test scripts
* Generate:

  * HTML reports in `docs/reports/`
  * JSON logs
  * Slack/Telegram/Email alerts if configured
  * AI suggestions if errors are detected (Phase 5+)

---

#### 3. 🔍 **View the HTML Report**

Once it completes, check:

```
docs/reports/index.html
```

Use Replit’s preview panel or download the file to view full charts, test-by-test breakdowns, response times, and errors.

---

#### 4. 🧪 **Trigger a test failure manually (to verify alerts)**

Run:

```bash
node scripts/trigger-full-alert-test.js
```

It will:

* Simulate 2 failed test cases
* Trigger:

  * Slack alert block
  * Email alert message (via Mailgun)
  * Telegram alert message
  * Signed test report URL (JWT-secured)
  * Log to `logs/test-report-access.log`

---

#### 5. ✅ **View Alert Logs**

To confirm alerts fired properly, check:

```bash
cat logs/test-report-access.log
```

You’ll see when, who accessed what report, and from where.

---

### 💡 Optional Enhancements

* `npm run test:api` → Shortcut for `newman-test-runner.js`
* `npm run test:report:csv` → Export result stats to CSV
* `npm run test:report:pdf` → Save as PDF (using Puppeteer or wkhtmltopdf)

---

### 🔐 Admin-Only Tests

To test JWT-secured routes, pass your access token in `scripts/newman-test-runner.js` or test manually with:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" http://localhost:5000/api/admin/dashboard
```

Would you like me to:

* 🧠 Generate **PDF or CSV export** of results?
* 🔐 Generate new signed URL for test report?
* 🔄 Schedule auto-test runs every 6h via Replit cron?
* 🔬 Add new tests for features not yet covered?

Just say:

> `"🧪 Add new tests for XYZ"`
> `"📈 Export report to CSV"`
> `"🔁 Schedule auto-run"`

And I’ll handle it for you.
