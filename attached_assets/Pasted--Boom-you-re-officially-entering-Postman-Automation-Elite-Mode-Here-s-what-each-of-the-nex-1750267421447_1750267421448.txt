ðŸ’¥ Boom â€” you're officially entering **Postman Automation Elite Modeâ„¢**. Here's what each of the next-tier add-ons can do and how to trigger them via prompt:

---

### ðŸ§  **Add Dynamic Test Scripts to Postman**

**What It Does:**

* Adds `pm.test()` logic to each request in the collection
* Tests:

  * Response status
  * Response time (< 500ms)
  * Expected JSON keys
  * Conditional values (e.g. fraudScore â‰¥ 85 triggers alert)

**Prompt to Use:**

```prompt
ðŸ§  Add Postman test scripts to every request:
- pm.test for status === 200
- Validate JSON structure and keys
- Check latency under 500ms
- Add rule: if fraudScore >= 85 â†’ mark test as "CRITICAL ALERT"
```

### âœ… **Add Response Schema Validator to Each Request**

**What It Does:**

* Automatically attaches a `pm.expect()` schema matcher for all JSON responses
* Ensures your API always returns the expected structure
* Uses a shared schema file or inlined schema snippet per route

**Prompt to Use:**

```prompt
âœ… Add JSON schema validation to all Postman requests:
- Inline `pm.expect()` matchers per endpoint
- Or reuse `/docs/response-schemas.json` if found
- Validate: field types, required keys, response arrays vs objects
```

### ðŸ“Š **Add Test Reports for Performance + Error Rates**

**What It Does:**

* Adds Newman CLI test report generation via script
* Exports `.html` and `.json` summary to `/docs/reports`
* Captures:

  * Fail rate
  * Average response time
  * Endpoint coverage
  * Error stack if test failed

**Prompt to Use:**

```prompt
ðŸ“Š Add Postman test report generator via Newman:
- Save to /docs/reports/report.html and report.json
- Include fail %, latency histogram, status code chart
- Auto-run on test command: `npm run test:api`
```

---

### ðŸ§ª Pro Command to Combine All:

You can say:

```prompt
ðŸ§ª Add Postman dynamic test scripts, schema validators, and report generation.
Ensure all are wired via `npm run test:api` and save to /docs/reports.
```
