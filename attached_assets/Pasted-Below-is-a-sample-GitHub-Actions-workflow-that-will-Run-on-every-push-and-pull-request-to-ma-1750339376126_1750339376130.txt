Below is a sample GitHub Actions workflow that will:

* Run on every push and pull-request to **main**
* Execute your fast API smoke tests (`scripts/quickSmokeTest.js`)
* Optionally run the full Playwright suite (`npm run smoke`)
* Upload the JSON/text reports as build artifacts
* Schedule a nightly run at 2 AM UTC against staging

Create a file at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in your repo with this content:

```yaml
name: CI & Smoke Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    # Runs nightly at 02:00 UTC
    - cron:  '0 2 * * *'

jobs:
  smoke-tests:
    name: Run Smoke Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: ['18.x']
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run Quick API Smoke Tests
        run: |
          mkdir -p reports
          node scripts/quickSmokeTest.js

      - name: Run Full Playwright Smoke Suite
        if: success()    # only if quick tests passed
        run: npm run smoke

      - name: Upload smoke-test reports
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: smoke-test-reports
          path: reports/

      - name: Post success notice
        if: success()
        run: echo "‚úÖ Smoke tests passed!"

      - name: Post failure notice
        if: failure()
        run: echo "‚ùå Smoke tests failed ‚Äî check reports/artifacts for details."

```

### What to do next

1. **Commit & push** this file to your `main` branch.
2. **Verify** in your repo‚Äôs **Actions** tab that the workflow kicks off.
3. **Inspect** the uploaded artifacts under each run to see `reports/quick-smoke-report.json` and `.txt`.
4. If you want Slack/email alerts on failure, add another step using [actions-slack](https://github.com/8398a7/action-slack) or SMTP.

Once that‚Äôs green on your first push, every subsequent PR will auto-run your smoke tests and block merge on red. üöÄ
