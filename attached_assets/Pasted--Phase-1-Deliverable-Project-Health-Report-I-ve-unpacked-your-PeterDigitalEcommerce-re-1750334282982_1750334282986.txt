**Phase 1 Deliverable: Project Health Report 🚦**

I’ve unpacked your **PeterDigitalEcommerce** repo and done an initial scan. Here’s where we stand:

| Module              | Path                    | Purpose                                                    | Initial Status / Notes                                          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Client App**      | `client/`               | React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind front-end             | No obvious TODOs; needs end-to-end UI flow tests                |
| **Server API**      | `server/`               | Node.js + Express + Drizzle ORM backend                    | 1 TODO in `routes.ts`; verify all endpoints & middleware        |
| **Shared Libs**     | `shared/`               | Common types, utilities                                    | No stubs found; audit for duplication vs. client/server overlap |
| **Configs**         | `config/` & root files  | Env management, Drizzle config, Vite & Tailwind setup      | `.env.example` present; missing real credentials for full test  |
| **Scripts**         | `scripts/`              | Test runners (Newman, Postman), code-structure reports     | 5+ test scripts exist—need to integrate into CI                 |
| **Docs & Reports**  | `docs/`, `SiZuPay_*.md` | Architecture diagrams, deep-audit and resurrection reports | Outdated vs. code? Sync docs with current reality               |
| **Templates**       | `templates/`            | Email, view, or notification templates?                    | Inspect for placeholder/demo content                            |
| **Attached Assets** | `attached_assets/`      | Pasted test logs, API responses                            | Archive to docs once parsed into formal reports                 |

🔍 **Quick Metrics**

* **TODOs found**: 4 (3 in `client/src/lib/square.ts`; 1 in `server/routes.ts`)
* **Test scripts**: 8+ custom runners under `scripts/` and several docs in `attached_assets/`
* **No dedicated `__tests__` or `tests/` directories**—coverage gaps likely

## Next Steps: Kick-off Phase 1 Proper

1. **Environment Setup**

   * I need your staging credentials (or a `.env` with safe test keys) to run the full integration suite against a real database and payment sandbox.
2. **Module Inventory & Ownership**

   * Confirm who “owns” each module (client, server, shared). We’ll tag each file with an owner for targeted deep dives.
3. **Detailed Audit Plan**

   * I’ll begin walking through **every** directory, file by file, verifying:

     * Real vs. placeholder logic
     * Full UI↔API integration points
     * Data models vs. actual database schema
4. **Deliver “Health Report v1.0”**

   * A spreadsheet/Trello with each module’s status: ✅ clean / ⚠️ needs work / ❌ broken
   * A prioritized action list for closing gaps

Once you share the staging `.env` (or credentials), I’ll spin up the project, run your existing scripts, and start logging breakpoints. From there, I’ll produce **Health Report v1.0** and we’ll march into cleanup and testing.

**Sound good?** Send over your test-safe environment details, and we’ll dive in—no fluff, just results. 🚀
